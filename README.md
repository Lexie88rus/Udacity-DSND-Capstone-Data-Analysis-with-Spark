Machine learning on a large dataset using PySpark

## Project Overview
Predicting churn rates is a challenging and common problem that data scientists and analysts regularly encounter in any customer-facing business. It is crucial for businesses to identify customers who are about to churn and take action to retain them before it happens.
The goal of this project was to help Sparkify music service retain their customers. In this project, I analyzed Sparkify data, built a machine learning model to predict churn and developed a web app to demonstrate the results.
